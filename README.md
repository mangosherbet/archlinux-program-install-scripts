On a clean install of arch linux, install all my favorite programs with one command for pacman and yay. 

Make sure to run: 

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

before running any of these install scripts to ensure your system is fully updated. 

and also make sure to: 
- Run Pacman install script before the yay install script as this file installs `yay` if not currently present 

Installs: 

# Pacman
- Thunderbird
- Inkscape
- Gimp

Note: use at your own risk
